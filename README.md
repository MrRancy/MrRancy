# Teja Surisetty - @MrRancy

Hello friend! I'm Teja Surisetty, a Polyglot Developer who loves building solutions. I'm most familiar with Blockchain, JavaScript (NodeJS), Java, and Angular - however my working area changes with the requirement based on my work. I love learning new things, building hardware projects, and am attempting to build my startup!
